# rshell

A shell built in Rust. The idea for the project comes from [Coding Challenges](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-shell).

## Running the program

1. Clone the repository.

    ```shell
    git clone <https://github.com/Kosciarz/rshell.git>
    ```

2. Run the program with Cargo.

    ```shell
    cargo run
    ```

## Usage

After running the program, you can enter commands just like in a typical shell. For example:

```shell
ls
pwd
echo "Hello, rshell!"
```

## What I learned

- Input/Output in Rust
- Error handling in Rust
- Creating and managing new processes in Rust
