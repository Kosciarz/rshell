# rshell

A shell built in Rust. The idea for the project comes from [Coding Challenges](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-shell).

## Running and using the shell

1. Clone the repository.

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/Kosciarz/rshell.git
    ```

2. Run the program with Cargo.

    ```shell
    cargo run
    ```

3. Pass in whichever commands you like

    ```shell
    ls
    pwd
    echo "Hello, rshell!"
    ```

## What I learned

- Input/Output in Rust
- Error handling in Rust
- Creating and managing new processes in Rust
